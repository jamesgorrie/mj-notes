#### Projects

#### 3. Apprenticeship Project

Site to be planned, designed, developed and deployed by apprentice.

##### 4. Synoptic Project

The synoptic project requires the apprentice to complete a business-related project in a controlled environment testing the application of a selection of knowledge, skills and behaviours defined in the standard. Each project will specify which selection of knowledge, skills and behaviours it is designed to test. Each of these projects will present a typical business task, appropriate for an SME, an IT business, a large corporate or non-IT business. All of the projects will be comparable in terms of content and complexity, it is the context within which the skills and knowledge must be demonstrated that will vary. Centres and employers will be able to assist the apprentice to select the most appropriate project based on their current job role from a selection of project briefs.

#### Coursework

##### 5. Summative Portfolio

A summative portfolio focuses on the demonstration of achievement and should be constructed to show the best of what an apprentice can do against the specified standards. It is expected that most, if not all, evidence collated for a summative portfolio would be sourced from the final part of the apprenticeship. It will be produced towards the end of the apprenticeship, containing evidence from real work projects which have been completed during the apprenticeship, which when taken together cover the totality of the standard.
A summative portfolio may include some supplementary sections, eg apprentice reflection on previously carried-out work.

#### Other Assessment requirements

##### 6. Interview

The interview will take a maximum of 120 minutes
- What you submitted in the summative portfolio
- What you produced in the synoptic project
- The standard of your work, as evidenced in the portfolio and the project
- How you approached the work submitted in the portfolio and the project.

##### 7. Employer Reference
